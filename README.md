# Stud.IP OAuth Consumer Example Plugin

## Description

This plugin is supposed to be a working example consuming a Stud.IP
resource which is behind OAuth.

## Test client

Although the library used for the server side implementation could also manage the client communication, a different library was chosen on purpose to ensure compatibility.

## Credits

- OAuth client uses the [OAuth library](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.oauth.introduction.html) from the [Zend Framework 1.11](http://framework.zend.com/)
