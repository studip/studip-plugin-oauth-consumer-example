# Stud.IP OAuth Consumer Example Plugin

## Description

This plugin is supposed to be a working example consuming a Stud.IP
resource which is behind OAuth.

## Test client

Although the library used for the server side implementation could also manage the client communication, a different library was chosen on purpose to ensure compatibility.

## Credits

- OAuth client uses [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) with the [Guzzle OAuth Subscriber](https://github.com/guzzle/oauth-subscriber)
